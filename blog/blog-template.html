<!-- I wanted to create a separate template from my blog post than the woman I was working with, so we created out own wireframes separately and talked about them. And it was nice to have a person I could bounce ideas off of, and comiserate about the workload and all. It felt odd to work silently on my screen while a stranger did the same thing, but also weirdly soothing. I didn't learn about any new semantic elemnts, though. -->
