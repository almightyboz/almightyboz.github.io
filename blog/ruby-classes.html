    <section class="blog-post"><p>I had a lot of trouble understanding why we need classes at all in Ruby. I mean that. I figured that a lot could be accomplished with methods and local variables, you didn't need classes to write programs. This isn't strictly speaking false, but it pretty naive.</p>
<p>A class in Ruby is a container that holds linked operations and bits of information. But why build a container? Broadly speaking, keeping it in the container helps make sure that bits of information aren't leaking in or out that will spoil the operations. Holding that process in a container makes it easier to test that the operations all work together, and makes it easier to cobble together other containers to build a more complicated machine.</p>
<p>But it involves, first and foremost, the cognitive ability to link actions and information that are related in some way, or that operate together. And it can occur down all sorts of domains, and once you start thinking that way, you're stuck.</p>
<p>Let's talk breakfast. "MakingBreakfast" is a subset of my day in which I conduct a series of specialized tasks in a particular order, and create new objects from raw materials. Of course, I could break it down even further, in different ways. What if I divided my time into class FridgeTasks, class CounterTasks, and class StoveTasks. I could, I suppose. I would divide into activities that all take in the same input to create the same output. Let's take my MakeCoffee class.</p>b
<code>
class MakeCoffee
  attr_accessor :brew
  def initialize(beans, water)
    @beans = roasted coffee beans
    @water = clean tap water
  end

  def check_beans
    when @beans.texture
      case fine
        @beans.aeropress
      case coarse
        @beans.load_machine
      case whole
        @beans.grind!
      end
    end

    ...

  def make_coffee
    return @brew
  end

end</code>
