      <h2>Hashes and Arrays.</h2>

      <p>In which I compare parties to a line at the Apple Store</p>
    </section>

    <section class="blog-post"><p>This week we're going to talk a bit about Ruby. Specifically, the structures that hold the information. (They have to hold it in a way that makes sense to Ruby and to you.) But what might that mean? Well, let's say we wanted to hold a big batch of linked information together. How could I do that in a way that's less of a pain for Ruby and I to both understand and work with?</p>

    <p><span>What is an Array?</span></p>
    <p>An array is an ordered list of entities/objects in ruby. Always denoted by square brackets. What do I mean when I say it's an ordered list? I'm saying that one can access and keep track of individual entries by knowing what position in line they are in. You cannot meddle with the order in the array without changing the fundamental nature of the array. Think of an array as like the line for an iPhone 7. All sorts of entities are watching that you don't cut the line. And it's an effecient way to keep a large group of motivated people waiting, so they can be processed one-by-one when it's time to ring up their purchase(s).</p>

    <p><span>What is a Hash?</span></p>
    <p>A hash is like two lists melded together. Every entry on a Hash is two objects in ruby. One is a key. Ruby will check every key in a hash against any given key. If they are identical. To make the key metaphor more literal, If an array is the line in front of the Apple Store on Black Friday, a hash is the seating plan to a huge party or wedding. A person who had the seating plan could stand in the middle of the dance floor, look at the plan, and know that Jessica is at table 8 and not table 3 with Nicki. You human brain could do a lot more with that knowledge. You could remind yourself that Jessica became friends with the groom in college, but isn't an ex-girlfriend, so she probably sites near the center table. If you need help, you know that Tim also knew the groom in college, so he will be sitting at Jessica's table. And Tim, being a 300 pound, 6'5" redhead, is an easy person to scan for visually.</p>

    <p><span>Wait, aren't Arrays basically just Hashes? Hashes are indexed by their key-value pairs (look up the key to find the value and vice versa), and arrays are indexed by their order. Couldn't you just say that an array is a hash in which the key pairs are integers from 0 to array.length?</span></p>
    <p> Yes you could, I suppose. Maybe you could think that an array is a hash for which you can't be bothered to find proper key values? You seem to really be getting this, though. Awesome.
