    Margin is the transparent area immediately surrounding the border.
Border is the area between margin and padding. It can be different colors and formats (solid, dashed, etc)
Padding is the transparent area immediately around the content.
The content is the "meat," the actual HTML code that you wish to style.

<p>I get confused and mix them up. So I imagine a scenario as such. I have in my posession a delicate ceramic figurine that I want to transport. The figurine is a very delicate statuette of a naked woman giving a naked man an enema while he play the trombone. It's my favorite figurine, but I don't want to break it, nor do I want other people to see what it is right off the back. So I want to create a carrying compartment for it, ideally one that I can use for my other sexually suggestive ceramic figurines. First I cover the figurine with bubble wrap, which is clear and acts as padding. That blurs the look of the statute (you can't see the nozzle of the enema, or the expression on the trombone player's face), which makes it easier to carry around. Then I cover the padded figurine with a piece of cloth that has pictures of the North Korean DMZ, one of the most fortified national borders on earth. Finally, I give the padded, wrapped, and bordered package to my friend Marvin (margin). I figure people will give him trouble and not me if they notice what he's carrying. And Marvin can take it, he's got a thick skin.</p></section>
