      <p>Let's say I have a chunk of html code, and I want to style it. CSS gives me the ability to make containers of any size and color to hold my code, and does so using the box model.</p>
      <p>From the outside in, the box model is as such:
    Margin is the transparent area immediately surrounding the border.
Border is the area between margin and padding. It can be different colors and formats (solid, dashed, etc)
Padding is the transparent area immediately around the content.
The content is the "meat," the actual HTML code that you wish to style.
  </p>
<p>I get confused and mix the three up. Their names aren't very descriptive on their own, and it's a matter of memorizing. So I imagine a scenario as such. I have in my posession a delicate ceramic figurine that I want to transport. The figurine is a very delicate statuette of a naked woman giving a naked man an enema while he play the trombone. (You can use your own mental image for the figurine, so long as it is memorable. For me that means it's weird and borderline inappropriate, but I have faith that you are less of a weirdo than I am.) It's my favorite figurine, but I don't want to break it, nor do I want other people to see what it is right off the bat. So I want to create a carrying compartment for it, ideally one that I can use for my other sexually suggestive ceramic figurines. First I cover the figurine with bubble wrap, which is clear and acts as padding. That blurs the look of the statute (you can't see the nozzle of the enema, or the expression on the trombone player's face), which makes it easier to carry around. Then I cover the padded figurine with a piece of cloth that has pictures of the North Korean DMZ, one of the most fortified national borders on earth. Finally, I give the padded, wrapped, and bordered package to my friend Marvin (margin). I figure people will give him trouble and not me if they notice what he's carrying. And Marvin can take it, he's got a thick skin.</p></section>

    Static - Default CSS positioning. Not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties. Positioned according to the normal cascading flow of the page.
    Relative - Positioned relative to its normal(static) position, based on other positioning elements. (E.g.
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    would shift the element's position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.)
    Fixed - Stays in the same place on the viewport even if the page is scrolled. Needs top, right, bottom, and left to position the element. Used in ads, and current Wikipedia funding drive.
    Absolute - Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor in the HTML. If no positioned ancestors, uses document body and moves down with page scrolling
