      <p>Front-end web developer and freelance swimming instructor. I think of o myself as an East Coast transplant in Chicago. I have  an undergraduate degree in British history, mostly self-taught to code. When I'm not drinking soymilk-spiked coffee out of my skull mug, I can be found doing pilates, glowering into my laptop, and reading books. <p>
