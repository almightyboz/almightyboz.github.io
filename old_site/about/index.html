        <p>I came to Chicago to matriculate at the University of Chicago. I swam breaststoke for the swim team my first year and fell in love with the city. (The actions were unrelated in every way but temporarily.) I was and am fascinated by the Enlightenment, so I studied history, and wrote my thesis on the English  Revolution of 1689. After graduating, I worked full-time in legal support for two years. There I discovered the joy of automating a small task, and was obsessed with figuring out exactly what I could make that machine do.</p> <p>I quit my job to teach myself Python, and I quit teaching myself Python to do Dev Bootcamp, starting in February 2016. When I'm not working, I can be found doing pilates and reading books.</p>
