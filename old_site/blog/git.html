      Version control allows a single person to track the iterations of their code through rewrites, seeing at each step what was added or taken away. It allows a team of people to create a central copy of a piece of code, work independently on their own versions of the code, then compare the edits/additions/subtractions among each other and against the original code.

        Git has an automated function to time stamp commits and to mark each commit with the name of the person who made it. It also *requires* the person making the commit to write a message explaining why she chose to make her changes.

        GitHub can be accessed anywhere, site's users can group themselves into organizations for collaboration on projects. It also allows a person to specify what kind of software license they wish to use.
