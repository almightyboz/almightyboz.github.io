      There's a row of sheep lining up ahead of you, and your arm is tired from shearing them. You need a break. But your trusty robot servant is beside you, and you can program it to shave your sheep while you take a nap and binge watch Supernatural. But how do you tell your robot what to do? You once told it "milk everything" and left it alone in the barn, only to later return and find that it siphoned all the gas from your tractor and car, took the paint off the walls, and killed half the chickens trying to milk absolutely everything in the barn.</p>
      <p>Here's what I would say. "Okay, robot. If there's a sheep in front of you, call it forward to shear it. Once it's in front of you, gently grab it, take the shears, and look for a place on the sheep's body where there is woolly fleece. If you can find any, cut it off with the shears, without cutting it's skin. Once there is no more fleece on that animal, let go of it and stand up. If the sheep isn't getting up, come back and get me. Then tell the animal to head off into the pasture to eat. If there is still a line of sheep in front of you, do that same procedure.</p>
      <p>I just described two uses of the map() method on an array in Ruby. Whenever one has to repeat a certain set of identical steps on several items in an row, one uses it. It's one of the most important methods I think I've encountered so far. The hard part is determining how to structure of the set of steps that the map method will carry out. Map() makes it easy.</p>
      <p>Although if you really wanted to be a good farmer, you would be well served in seeing how your robot shaves a sequence of wooden sheep dummies. That way you could use it to shave your sheep all the time, and get more time to catch up on Sam and Dean's adventures. Just a thought.
