  What is object_oriented programming
A software paradigm that operates as a collection of discrete cooperating objects, instead of functions or commands. Each object is a machine in iteslf that can take, process, and send information to other objects. It's popularity for large-scale software engineering has roots in how it creates flexible and easy to maintain code.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript)

What is prototype based programming
An OOP model for consolidating code and using objects. Unlike declaring a class structure in languages like Ruby, the programmer can clone new objects from existing ones. All of which are linked to the parent object in the program and in their behavior. You can change and add to the definition or operation of these objects at any time using the object's prototype.

What is an object?
Containers for named values and operations. All objects of the same prototype have the same properties, but the values of each property differ. Simiarly, they may have the same methods, but performed at different imes.

How do we use objects in JS

What are properties?

(http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_properties.asp)

How are properties used?

What are methods?
Actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are stored in properties as function definitions. They can be added to an object or called with the object declaration.
(http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp)


Why do JS objects use "this"? What does that mean?
In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code. The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the function. The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself. The this keyword in an object constructor does not have a value. It is only a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when the constructor is used to create an object.
(http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp)


How are objects different from Ruby objects

What mistakes can one make in trying to make an object?
Declaring strings, number, or booleans as objects.
There are many style guides.(https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)

Object Literal Function
myFather.name = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

What is constructor functions?


function person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}
person.prototype.name = function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};
